# Tableau-Server

This repo is a collection of my various efforts to automate things with Tableau Server. Here you'll find snippets meant to make it easier to create your own scripts. It's organized around these topics:

### REST API

Functions and examples for working with Tableau Server's REST API.

### Vizportal API

Functions for interacting with the Vizportal (Undocumented) API. *Note: This is not the same thing as the Javascript API*

### Postgres

Functions and queries for extracting data from Tableau Server's Postgres database.
